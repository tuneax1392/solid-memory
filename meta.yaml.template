  summary: This is a module for the AWS SDK for C. It handles all IO and TLS work for application protocols.
  description: |
    This is an event driven framework for implementing application protocols. It is built on top of cross-platform 
    abstractions that allow you as a developer to think only about the state machine and API for your protocols.
    A typical use-case would be to write something like Http on top of asynchronous-io with TLS already baked in. 
    All of the platform and security concerns are already handled for you.
